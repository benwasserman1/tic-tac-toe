Instructions on how to run program:
- open 3 terminal windows
-first run MtServer.java class
-then run the MtClient.java class twice on each of the other 2 terminals respectively
-game will launch, you will have ability to enter colum index and row index
- by entering 11 you are telling the game that player 1 is marking colum 1 row 1
- player 2 (in the second Client terminal window) will not be able to mark 11 on the board as it has already been taken, but can mark any other spot on the 3 x 3 tic tac board
- in case of a tie the program will tell the users that a tie was found and there was no winner
-in case of a win by either player the program will thank the users for playing and exit.
